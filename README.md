reusing portions of it, combining it with another proprietary design or
remaking it into something else.

Subject to terms outlined in this paragraph, you also get geographically
unlimited rights to resell this design and keep 100% of the money provided that

distribute on your own. 

Guarantees
----------
I can only guarantee you that everything works as intended to the degree that I
have personally verified it in over 100 hours of live video that I have
recorded about this design. So if you in any way feel uncertain about your
purchase, make sure you do your homework. It would be very unfortunate if your
expectaions about what you are purchasing would not be met after you have
received your purchase. My online archive of live videos show you in detail every
step of the design giving you more than enough information to be able to make an
informed decision about your puchase.
